# Exercise - Explore data

Data exploration and analysis is typically an iterative process, in which the data scientist takes a sample of data, and performs the following kinds of task to analyze it and test hypotheses:

* Clean data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.
* Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data, and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.
* Visualize data to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.
* Derive new features from existing ones that might better encapsulate relationships within the data.
* Revise the hypothesis and repeat the process.

Data scientists can use a variety of tools and techniques to explore, visualize, and manipulate data. One of the most common ways in which data scientists work with data is to use the Python language and some specific packages for data processing.

The best way to learn about exploring and preparing data is to try it for yourself, so that's what you'll do in this exercise.

## Before you start
To complete the exercise, you'll need:

* A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com/free .
* An Azure Machine Learning workspace with a compute instance and the ml-basics repository cloned.

 ### Note

_This module is one of many that make use of an Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you are completing this module as part of the Create machine learning models  learning path or in preparation for the Azure Data Scientist  certification, consider creating the workspace once and reusing it in other modules. After completing the exercise, be sure to follow the Clean Up instructions to stop compute resources, and retain the workspace if you plan to reuse it._

## Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
If you don't already have an Azure Machine Learning workspace in your Azure subscription, follow these steps to create one:

1. Sign into the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
2. Select ＋ Create a resource, search for Machine Learning, and create a new Machine Learning resource with the following settings:

* Workspace Name: enter a unique name of your choice
* Subscription: your Azure subscription
* Resource group: create a new resource group with a unique name
* Location: choose any available location

3. Wait for your workspace resource to be created (it can take a few minutes). Then go to it in the portal, and on the Overview page for your workspace, launch Azure Machine Learning studio (or navigate to https://ml.azure.com ), and sign in using your Microsoft account.
4. In Azure Machine Learning studio, toggle the ☰ icon at the top left to view the various pages in the interface. You can use these pages to manage the resources in your workspace.

## Create a compute instance
To run the notebook used in this exercise, you will need a compute instance in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

1. In Azure Machine Learning studio https://ml.azure.com , view the Compute page for your workspace (under Manage).
2. On the Compute Instances tab, if you already have a compute instance, start it; otherwise create a new compute instance with the following settings:

* Compute name: enter a unique name
* Virtual Machine type: CPU
* Virtual Machine size: Standard_DS11_v2

3. Wait for the compute instance to start (this may take a minute or so)

## Clone the ml-basics repository
Use the following steps to clone the repository to your Azure Machine Learning workspace:

1. In Azure Machine Learning studio https://ml.azure.com , on the Compute page, view your running compute instance.

2. Use the Jupyter link to open Jupyter Notebooks in a new browser tab.

3. In the Jupyter page, on the New menu, select Terminal. This will open a new tab with a terminal shell.

4. In the terminal shell, run the following commands to change the current directory to the Users directory, and clone the ml-basics repository, which contains the notebook and files you will use in this exercise:

_Copy_

**cd Users** 

**git clone https://github.com/microsoftdocs/ml-basics**

5. After the command has completed and the checkout of the files is done, close the terminal tab and view the home page in your Jupyter notebook file explorer. Then open the Users folder - it should contain an ml-basics folder, containing the files you will use in the rest of this exercise.

### Note

_We highly recommend using Jupyter in an Azure Machine Learning workspace for this exercise. This setup ensures the correct version of Python and the various packages you will need are installed; and after creating the workspace once, you can reuse it in other modules. If you prefer to complete the exercise in a Python environment on your own computer, you can do so. You'll find details for configuring a local development environment that uses Visual Studio Code at Running the labs on your own computer . Be aware that if you choose to do this, the instructions in the exercise may not match your notebooks user interface._

## Explore data in a Jupyter notebook
After you've created a Jupyter environment and cloned the ml-basics repository, you're ready to explore data.

1. In Jupyter, open the Data Exploration.ipynb notebook in the ml-basics folder and follow the instructions it contains.
2. When you've finished, close and halt the notebook.

## Clean-up
If you used a compute instance in an Azure Machine Learning workspace to complete the exercise, use these steps to clean up.

1. Close all Jupyter notebooks and the Jupyter home page.
2. In Azure Machine Learning Studio, on the Compute page, select your compute instance and stop it.

If you don't intend to complete other modules that require the Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can delete the resource group you created for it from your Azure subscription.\
